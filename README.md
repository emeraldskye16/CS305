8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that engaged Global Rain to enhance its software applications. The firm specializes in savings, retirement planning, investment strategies, and insurance services for its clients. Global Rain’s   role involves developing a secure platform that allows customers to upload documents and access their accounts, with a key focus on ensuring data transfer integrity.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

A key strength of this project was the ability to generate checksum values using a variety of encryption algorithms, ensuring data validation irrespective of the security protocols in place. Prioritizing secure coding is essential, no matter the scope of the application. Protecting customer data and company information, especially in an era of digital attacks and piracy, must be an integral consideration throughout every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found reading and understanding the vulnerability report generated from Maven dependency checks particularly challenging. There was a lot of information to sift through, much of which was new to me before I started this course. However, running dependency checks is crucial, especially for applications that depend heavily on frameworks and external APIs for data gathering and manipulation.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

My strategy for enhancing security layers in the application centered on employing various encryption algorithms, tailored to the specific actions being performed. For instance, some algorithms are more effective for validating data within a file, while others excel in user credential authentication. Adopting a multi-layered approach to encryption and security is a practice I intend to pursue in future applications and projects.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure the web application's functionality, I performed individual tests on each component before assessing the integration of both internal and external resources. After making updates to the code, I ran further vulnerability checks to confirm that no new errors were introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The documentation for the Spring framework, along with guides on creating and interpreting vulnerability reports, played a significant role in the development of this project. I've found that consulting the documentation for any specific tool or programming language is particularly beneficial, especially when working with unfamiliar tools.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would highlight the vulnerability reports, specifically the documentation and analysis I created based on the findings. Comprehending security reports is vital to web development, particularly for future employers. Although I may not yet feel fully confident in interpreting these reports, this project has improved my understanding and set me toward greater expertise.
